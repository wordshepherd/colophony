## Track 1 — Core Infrastructure ✓

> **Status:** Code and QA complete. Remaining ops items moved to Production Deployment Checklist.

### Code

- [x] Security headers via @fastify/helmet (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options) — (security checklist)

## Track 2 — Colophony API

### Code

- [x] oRPC REST API surface — PR 1: contracts + organizations (replaces ts-rest; done 2026-02-18) — (architecture doc Track 2)
- [x] oRPC REST API surface — PR 2: submissions, files, users, API keys contracts + OpenAPI spec endpoint — (DEVLOG 2026-02-18; done 2026-02-18)

- [x] API key scope enforcement on GraphQL surface — `requireScopes` guard wired on all 10 query resolvers — (DEVLOG 2026-02-18; done 2026-02-19)
- [x] Stripe webhook: audit raw payload storage for PCI compliance — `stripe.webhook.ts` stores raw event payload in `stripe_webhook_events`; verified: Checkout Session events contain amounts/currency/payment_intent ID/metadata only, never card numbers/CVV/cardholder data. Added PCI note comment. — (Codex review 2026-02-18; done 2026-02-19)
- [x] Stripe webhook: `resourceId` passed to `insert_audit_event()` is Stripe session ID (`cs_...`), not UUID — fails `::uuid` cast in production. Fixed: removed `resourceId` from audit calls (session ID already in `newValue.stripeSessionId`); updated tests to use realistic `cs_test_` IDs. — (DEVLOG 2026-02-19; done 2026-02-19)
- [x] tRPC `.output()` runtime response validation — all 30 procedures wired with Zod output schemas; 9 new response schemas added — (input validation audit 2026-02-18; done 2026-02-18)

- [x] API documentation — Zod descriptions, oRPC metadata, GraphQL Pothos descriptions, Scalar UI, export scripts — (architecture doc Track 2; done 2026-02-19)

### Design Decisions

- [x] Submitter role architecture: per-org role assignment vs global identity with per-org role bindings — **Resolved 2026-02-19:** Submitter is a global user capability, not an org role. Staff roles (`ADMIN/EDITOR/READER`) unchanged. Manuscript library is user-owned and cross-org. Follow/subscribe for org-to-writer comms. — (architecture doc Open Question #1)
- [x] Self-serve org creation: managed hosting provisioning model vs self-hosted admin — **Partially resolved 2026-02-19:** Self-serve in both contexts. Managed hosting: free tier with quotas, paid upgrade, all features on all tiers. Self-hosted: no billing. Managed hosting infra deferred to post-Track 3. — (architecture doc Open Question #2)

- [x] Editor dashboard rewrite (`/editor` pages) — submission queue + detail view reuse — (DEVLOG 2026-02-15; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] Fix stale cache after submit: `submission-form.tsx` `submitMutation.onSuccess` does `router.push` but doesn't invalidate `getById` query — detail page shows stale DRAFT status — (DEVLOG 2026-02-18, E2E test run; done 2026-02-19)
- [x] Manuscript entity — separate manuscripts (with versions) from submissions; creators maintain a manuscript library and attach manuscripts to submissions rather than uploading per-submission. Enables one-click withdraw-on-accept across all pending submissions of the same manuscript — (roadmap idea 2026-02-19; backend done 2026-02-22)

- [x] [P2] E2E Playwright tests for embed form flow — 10 tests (8 core + 2 wizard), CI job added — (DEVLOG 2026-02-22, embed widget session; done 2026-02-22)
- [x] [P2] Manual QA of embed form widget — test iframe embedding on third-party page, identity step, form filling (flat + wizard), file uploads with scan status, error states, theme inheritance — (backlog 2026-02-23; done 2026-02-23 — found + fixed CORS + dark mode bugs)
- [x] [P3] Embed form genre validation: show human-readable labels instead of raw enum values — (manual QA 2026-02-23; done 2026-02-23)
- [x] [P2] Migration 0015 production reliability — `db:verify` / `db:verify:repair` scripts check `information_schema` for FK constraint drift and auto-repair; integrated into `db:reset` — (GDPR manual QA 2026-02-23; done 2026-02-23)

## Dependency Upgrades

> Most dependencies were not deliberately pinned — they were current-at-the-time when v2 started (Feb 2026).
> Several were already behind at that point. Prioritized by EOL risk and security impact.

### [P0] Urgent — EOL / Security

- [x] Node.js 20 → 22 LTS — Node 20 EOL is April 30, 2026; upgraded to v22.22.0 — (dependabot 2026-02-15, done 2026-02-16)
- [x] Next.js 15 → 16 + React 18 → 19 + eslint-config-next 15 → 16 — bundled upgrade; Next 16 requires React 19; Next 16 shipped Oct 2025 — (dependabot #79, #81, #75; done 2026-02-16)

### [P1] High — Major versions, actively maintained

- [x] Zod 3 → 4 — ground-up rewrite (stable May 2025); touches types package, all tRPC inputs, env config; largest migration surface — (dependabot #80; done 2026-02-17)
- [x] TanStack Query 4 → 5 — upgraded with tRPC 11; `isPending` alias pattern used; `fetchStatus` workaround removed from `use-auth.ts` — (dependabot #74; done 2026-02-17)
- [x] tRPC 10 → 11 — combined tRPC 11 + TQ5 + TS 5.7.2 migration; TS2742 quirk resolved — (CLAUDE.md version pin; done 2026-02-17)

### [P2] Medium — Dev tooling, lower risk

- [x] Vitest 3 → 4 — shipped Oct 2025; dev-only, but 261+ tests need validation — (dependabot #76; done 2026-02-17)
- [x] @testing-library/react 14 → 16 — dev-only; skipped v15; bundled with Next 16 + React 19 upgrade — (dependabot #78; done 2026-02-16)

### [P3] Low — Unused or minimal impact

- [ ] nodemailer 7 → 8 — Relay not built yet; upgrade when starting Relay — (dependabot #77)

### Upgrade order notes

- **Node 22** can be done independently — update `.nvmrc`, engines fields, CI matrix, test
- **Next 16 + React 19** must move together; eslint-config-next follows
- **Zod 4** should happen before or alongside **tRPC 11** since tRPC's Zod error behavior is the pin reason
- **TanStack Query 5** is independent but touches the same web app files as React 19

---

## Code Quality

### File Size & Complexity

- [x] Add soft 500-line guideline to CLAUDE.md — flag files over 500 lines for review during `/codex-review`; not a hard gate, just a review trigger — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Extract `validateFormData` and per-type validators from `form.service.ts` (912 lines) into `form-validation.service.ts` — natural seam between CRUD operations and validation logic — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)

### Dev Workflow

- [x] Structured session handoff doc (`session-handoff.md`, gitignored) — `/end-session` writes machine-readable state (branch, status, files touched, decisions made, open questions, next action) alongside DEVLOG narrative; `/start-session` reads handoff first for instant context restoration, falls back to DEVLOG if missing. DEVLOG becomes purely archival/human-readable — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Add decision-surfacing step to plan mode — after exploring code but before writing the plan, explicitly enumerate architectural gray areas and present them with a recommended path and rationale; get user preferences before committing to an approach. Still recommend, just surface the choice — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Integrate Codex plan review into plan mode — run `/codex-review plan` automatically after writing the plan but before ExitPlanMode; adjust plan based on findings, note changes and dismissals with rationale; user sees a Codex-vetted plan at approval time instead of reviewing then manually triggering Codex — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Increase plan specificity standard — plans should include exact file paths, concrete type/prop names, and named test cases with setup and assertions where feasible; specific enough to mechanically verify post-implementation. Update plan mode instructions in CLAUDE.md — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Plan drift detection — after implementation, verify that the delivered code matches the approved plan. Check that specified files exist, export expected symbols, and follow specified patterns. Run as part of `/codex-review branch` or as a standalone `/plan-drift` skill — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Plan override log for drift detection — during implementation, when discoveries require deliberate divergence from the plan, log overrides with rationale (file, what changed, why) in a structured format (e.g., task list metadata or a plan-overrides section in the PR). Drift detection reads the override log and excludes acknowledged divergences, only flagging unlogged drift — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Automatic Codex branch review before PR — run `/codex-review branch` automatically after implementation is complete (all tasks done, tests passing) but before creating the PR; incorporate findings before presenting the PR for user review. Mirrors the plan review integration: user sees a Codex-vetted PR, not a raw first draft — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)

### CI

- [x] [P2] CI path filtering for Playwright suites — skip irrelevant E2E suites on PRs based on changed files; `.github/scripts/detect-changes.sh` with fail-open strategy — (DEVLOG 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)

### Dev Environment

- [x] [P1] Add Overmind as process manager for dev servers — replaces `turbo run dev` for persistent server lifecycle (API + web); Turbo stays for build graph. Overmind manages tmux session so killing it kills entire process group — eliminates orphaned `tsx watch` / `next-server` / `postcss` processes that accumulate across sessions. Turbo's SIGINT forwarding is a known open issue (#9666, #9694). — (manual QA session 2026-02-21, found 60 orphaned processes; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P2] Add `dev:clean` script — kill processes on ports 4000/3000, remove stale lock files (`apps/web/.next/dev/lock`). Fallback for when Overmind isn't running or crashes. Add as `pnpm dev:clean` in root package.json. — (manual QA session 2026-02-21; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P2] Simplify Docker profile handling — wrapper script or Makefile target that always includes `--profile auth` for Zitadel. Current setup requires remembering `docker compose --profile auth up -d zitadel` separately from `docker compose up -d`. — (manual QA session 2026-02-21; done 2026-02-21)
- [ ] [P3] Docker Compose staging override — `docker-compose.staging.yml` with built API/web production images alongside shared infra services. For local staging testing and future deployed staging. Do NOT use `docker compose watch` for Next.js (Turbopack hot-reload bug, docker/compose#12827). — (manual QA session 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P2] Zitadel dev setup automation — `pnpm zitadel:setup` provisions Zitadel and patches .env files after volume wipe — (manual QA friction 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)
- [x] [P2] Stale org context recovery — `useOrganization` detects stale localStorage org ID and auto-switches — (manual QA friction 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)
- [x] [P2] Slate seed data — publications, pipeline items, issues, contracts, CMS connections in `db:seed` — (manual QA friction 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)

### QA Observations

- [x] [P2] Submission detail page: display custom form field data — `/submissions/[id]` detail view only shows Title, Content, and History. Custom form fields (Category, Word Count, Bio from form definitions) are not rendered. Form data is persisted and visible on edit page but not on read-only detail view. — (manual QA 2026-02-21, conditional logic testing; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P3] Submissions list stale cache after create — after creating a new submission via "Create Draft", navigating to My Submissions shows "No submissions" until page reload. Likely TanStack Query cache not invalidated on create mutation success. Submission does exist (API returned 200, detail page loads). — (manual QA 2026-02-21, conditional logic testing; done 2026-02-21)

### Monitoring

- [~] GitHub GraphQL rate limit passive drain (~60 pts/hr) — diagnosed 2026-02-19, likely GitHub-internal (Dependabot, security scanning). At ~1.2% budget/hr, not actionable unless large exhaustion recurs. If so, convert skills from `gh pr list/create` (GraphQL) to `gh api` (REST) — (DEVLOG 2026-02-19)
