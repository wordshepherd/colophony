- [x] Stripe webhook: audit raw payload storage for PCI compliance — `stripe.webhook.ts` stores raw event payload in `stripe_webhook_events`; verified: Checkout Session events contain amounts/currency/payment_intent ID/metadata only, never card numbers/CVV/cardholder data. Added PCI note comment. — (Codex review 2026-02-18; done 2026-02-19)
- [x] Stripe webhook: `resourceId` passed to `insert_audit_event()` is Stripe session ID (`cs_...`), not UUID — fails `::uuid` cast in production. Fixed: removed `resourceId` from audit calls (session ID already in `newValue.stripeSessionId`); updated tests to use realistic `cs_test_` IDs. — (DEVLOG 2026-02-19; done 2026-02-19)
- [x] tRPC `.output()` runtime response validation — all 30 procedures wired with Zod output schemas; 9 new response schemas added — (input validation audit 2026-02-18; done 2026-02-18)

- [x] API documentation — Zod descriptions, oRPC metadata, GraphQL Pothos descriptions, Scalar UI, export scripts — (architecture doc Track 2; done 2026-02-19)

### Design Decisions

- [x] Submitter role architecture: per-org role assignment vs global identity with per-org role bindings — **Resolved 2026-02-19:** Submitter is a global user capability, not an org role. Staff roles (`ADMIN/EDITOR/READER`) unchanged. Manuscript library is user-owned and cross-org. Follow/subscribe for org-to-writer comms. — (architecture doc Open Question #1)
- [x] Self-serve org creation: managed hosting provisioning model vs self-hosted admin — **Partially resolved 2026-02-19:** Self-serve in both contexts. Managed hosting: free tier with quotas, paid upgrade, all features on all tiers. Self-hosted: no billing. Managed hosting infra deferred to post-Track 3. — (architecture doc Open Question #2)

- [x] [P2] E2E Playwright tests for embed form flow — 10 tests (8 core + 2 wizard), CI job added — (DEVLOG 2026-02-22, embed widget session; done 2026-02-22)
- [x] [P2] Manual QA of embed form widget — test iframe embedding on third-party page, identity step, form filling (flat + wizard), file uploads with scan status, error states, theme inheritance — (backlog 2026-02-23; done 2026-02-23 — found + fixed CORS + dark mode bugs)
- [x] [P3] Embed form genre validation: show human-readable labels instead of raw enum values — (manual QA 2026-02-23; done 2026-02-23)

- [ ] Full marketplace website with ratings, reviews, compatibility matrix — (plugin research Section 11)

### Design Decisions

- [x] Plugin configuration storage: env vars only per-deployment for v2.0; per-org DB deferred to managed-hosting milestone — (plugin research Open Question #1; resolved 2026-02-26)
- [x] Hot-reload in production: restart required for v2.0; `destroy()` lifecycle exists for future support — (plugin research Open Question #2; resolved 2026-02-26)
- [x] Plugin marketplace governance: define criteria spec now, defer enforcement to v2.3+ — (plugin research Open Question #3; resolved 2026-02-26)
- [x] Database access for Tier 4 plugins: plugin data namespace (`ctx.store`) + read-only service API for v2.0 — (plugin research Open Question #4; resolved 2026-02-26)
- [x] Frontend plugin bundling: build-time only for v2.0; runtime loading deferred to v2.3+ — (plugin research Open Question #5; resolved 2026-02-26)
- [x] Webhook vs event bus for Tier 0: webhooks only for v2.0; pub/sub deferred post-launch — (plugin research Open Question #6; resolved 2026-02-26)

## Cross-Cutting — Relay (Notifications & Communications)

- [x] Email templates + provider integration (SMTP + SendGrid) — adapters, MJML templates, BullMQ queue/worker, notification preferences, Inngest functions — (architecture doc, Relay; done 2026-02-26)
- [x] Notification preferences frontend — UI for users to manage email opt-in/opt-out per event type — (DEVLOG 2026-02-26; done 2026-02-26)
- [x] Webhook delivery system (outbound) — (architecture doc, Relay; done 2026-02-26)
- [x] In-app notification center — SSE + Redis pub/sub + bell UI + dual-channel preferences — (architecture doc, Relay; done 2026-02-26)

## Dependency Upgrades

> Most dependencies were not deliberately pinned — they were current-at-the-time when v2 started (Feb 2026).
> Several were already behind at that point. Prioritized by EOL risk and security impact.

### [P0] Urgent — EOL / Security

- [x] Node.js 20 → 22 LTS — Node 20 EOL is April 30, 2026; upgraded to v22.22.0 — (dependabot 2026-02-15, done 2026-02-16)
- [x] Next.js 15 → 16 + React 18 → 19 + eslint-config-next 15 → 16 — bundled upgrade; Next 16 requires React 19; Next 16 shipped Oct 2025 — (dependabot #79, #81, #75; done 2026-02-16)

### [P1] High — Major versions, actively maintained

- [x] Zod 3 → 4 — ground-up rewrite (stable May 2025); touches types package, all tRPC inputs, env config; largest migration surface — (dependabot #80; done 2026-02-17)
- [x] TanStack Query 4 → 5 — upgraded with tRPC 11; `isPending` alias pattern used; `fetchStatus` workaround removed from `use-auth.ts` — (dependabot #74; done 2026-02-17)
- [x] tRPC 10 → 11 — combined tRPC 11 + TQ5 + TS 5.7.2 migration; TS2742 quirk resolved — (CLAUDE.md version pin; done 2026-02-17)

### [P2] Medium — Dev tooling, lower risk

- [x] Vitest 3 → 4 — shipped Oct 2025; dev-only, but 261+ tests need validation — (dependabot #76; done 2026-02-17)
- [x] @testing-library/react 14 → 16 — dev-only; skipped v15; bundled with Next 16 + React 19 upgrade — (dependabot #78; done 2026-02-16)

### [P3] Low — Unused or minimal impact

- [x] nodemailer 7 → 8 — already at v8.0.1; bumped @types/nodemailer 7.0.9 → 7.0.11 — (dependabot #77; done 2026-02-26)

### Upgrade order notes

- **Node 22** can be done independently — update `.nvmrc`, engines fields, CI matrix, test
- **Next 16 + React 19** must move together; eslint-config-next follows
- **Zod 4** should happen before or alongside **tRPC 11** since tRPC's Zod error behavior is the pin reason
- **TanStack Query 5** is independent but touches the same web app files as React 19

---

## Code Quality

### File Size & Complexity

- [x] Add soft 500-line guideline to CLAUDE.md — flag files over 500 lines for review during `/codex-review`; not a hard gate, just a review trigger — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Extract `validateFormData` and per-type validators from `form.service.ts` (912 lines) into `form-validation.service.ts` — natural seam between CRUD operations and validation logic — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)

### Dev Workflow

- [x] Structured session handoff doc (`session-handoff.md`, gitignored) — `/end-session` writes machine-readable state (branch, status, files touched, decisions made, open questions, next action) alongside DEVLOG narrative; `/start-session` reads handoff first for instant context restoration, falls back to DEVLOG if missing. DEVLOG becomes purely archival/human-readable — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Add decision-surfacing step to plan mode — after exploring code but before writing the plan, explicitly enumerate architectural gray areas and present them with a recommended path and rationale; get user preferences before committing to an approach. Still recommend, just surface the choice — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Integrate Codex plan review into plan mode — run `/codex-review plan` automatically after writing the plan but before ExitPlanMode; adjust plan based on findings, note changes and dismissals with rationale; user sees a Codex-vetted plan at approval time instead of reviewing then manually triggering Codex — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Increase plan specificity standard — plans should include exact file paths, concrete type/prop names, and named test cases with setup and assertions where feasible; specific enough to mechanically verify post-implementation. Update plan mode instructions in CLAUDE.md — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Plan drift detection — after implementation, verify that the delivered code matches the approved plan. Check that specified files exist, export expected symbols, and follow specified patterns. Run as part of `/codex-review branch` or as a standalone `/plan-drift` skill — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Plan override log for drift detection — during implementation, when discoveries require deliberate divergence from the plan, log overrides with rationale (file, what changed, why) in a structured format (e.g., task list metadata or a plan-overrides section in the PR). Drift detection reads the override log and excludes acknowledged divergences, only flagging unlogged drift — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)
- [x] Automatic Codex branch review before PR — run `/codex-review branch` automatically after implementation is complete (all tasks done, tests passing) but before creating the PR; incorporate findings before presenting the PR for user review. Mirrors the plan review integration: user sees a Codex-vetted PR, not a raw first draft — (dev workflow session 2026-02-20; done 2026-02-20)

### CI

- [x] [P2] CI path filtering for Playwright suites — skip irrelevant E2E suites on PRs based on changed files; `.github/scripts/detect-changes.sh` with fail-open strategy — (DEVLOG 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)

### Dev Environment

- [x] [P1] Add Overmind as process manager for dev servers — replaces `turbo run dev` for persistent server lifecycle (API + web); Turbo stays for build graph. Overmind manages tmux session so killing it kills entire process group — eliminates orphaned `tsx watch` / `next-server` / `postcss` processes that accumulate across sessions. Turbo's SIGINT forwarding is a known open issue (#9666, #9694). — (manual QA session 2026-02-21, found 60 orphaned processes; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P2] Add `dev:clean` script — kill processes on ports 4000/3000, remove stale lock files (`apps/web/.next/dev/lock`). Fallback for when Overmind isn't running or crashes. Add as `pnpm dev:clean` in root package.json. — (manual QA session 2026-02-21; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P2] Simplify Docker profile handling — wrapper script or Makefile target that always includes `--profile auth` for Zitadel. Current setup requires remembering `docker compose --profile auth up -d zitadel` separately from `docker compose up -d`. — (manual QA session 2026-02-21; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P3] Docker Compose staging override — `docker-compose.staging.yml` with built API/web production images alongside shared infra services. For local staging testing and future deployed staging. Do NOT use `docker compose watch` for Next.js (Turbopack hot-reload bug, docker/compose#12827). — (manual QA session 2026-02-21; done 2026-02-26)
- [x] [P2] Zitadel dev setup automation — `pnpm zitadel:setup` provisions Zitadel and patches .env files after volume wipe — (manual QA friction 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)
- [x] [P2] Stale org context recovery — `useOrganization` detects stale localStorage org ID and auto-switches — (manual QA friction 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)
- [x] [P2] Slate seed data — publications, pipeline items, issues, contracts, CMS connections in `db:seed` — (manual QA friction 2026-02-24; done 2026-02-24)

### QA Observations

- [x] [P2] Submission detail page: display custom form field data — `/submissions/[id]` detail view only shows Title, Content, and History. Custom form fields (Category, Word Count, Bio from form definitions) are not rendered. Form data is persisted and visible on edit page but not on read-only detail view. — (manual QA 2026-02-21, conditional logic testing; done 2026-02-21)
- [x] [P3] Submissions list stale cache after create — after creating a new submission via "Create Draft", navigating to My Submissions shows "No submissions" until page reload. Likely TanStack Query cache not invalidated on create mutation success. Submission does exist (API returned 200, detail page loads). — (manual QA 2026-02-21, conditional logic testing; done 2026-02-21)

- [ ] [P3] Status token rotation on R&R resubmission — generate new token when embed submitter resubmits after revise-and-resubmit; no resubmit flow in embed service yet — (audit remediation P2/P3, 2026-03-01)

### Editorial Workflow

- [x] [P1] Reviewer assignment per submission — assign one or more org members as readers on a submission; track who has read it; show assignment in submission detail — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)
- [x] [P1] Internal discussion threads on submissions — comment system on Hopper submissions (pre-acceptance), separate from the Slate pipeline comments (post-acceptance) — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)
- [x] [P2] Voting / scoring on submissions — readers cast votes (accept/reject/maybe + optional score); configurable per org; summary visible to editors making final decisions — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)
- [x] [P2] Blind / anonymous review mode — hide submitter identity from reviewers; admin toggle per submission period — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)

- [x] [P3] Response time tracking and reminders — flag submissions pending over N days (configurable); optional email reminder to editors — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)

### UI Polish

- [x] [P1] Mobile navigation — hamburger menu or bottom nav for `< md` breakpoints; sidebar is currently `hidden md:flex` with no mobile alternative — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)
- [x] [P2] Column sorting in submission queue — sortable by title, submitter, date, status; currently hardcoded `DESC createdAt` — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)
- [x] [P2] Submission period filter in editor queue — the API supports `submissionPeriodId` filter but the UI doesn't expose a period dropdown — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)
- [x] [P3] Saved filter presets / views — editors can save named filter+sort combos for their queue — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27; done 2026-02-28)

## Track 8 — Register Data Standard & Writer Tools (Pre-Launch)

> **Status:** Complete. All items shipped.

### Data Standard

- [x] [P0] Define CSR Zod schemas in `packages/types/src/csr.ts` — core CSR type hierarchy (Genre, CSRStatus, JournalRef, Correspondence, ExternalSubmission, WriterProfile, create/update schemas); full CSR v1.0 export envelope deferred to export endpoint work — (register-data-standard.md Section 2; done 2026-02-27 PR pending)

### Design Decisions

- [x] Personal workspace architecture — **Resolved:** Writers as top-level entities. New user-scoped tables (external_submissions, correspondence, writer_profiles, journal_directory) with RLS matching manuscripts pattern. No pseudo-org needed. — (2026-02-27)
- [x] CSR field set — **Resolved:** Layered format (core/extended/identity/metadata) with correspondence as first-class. Genre as structured enum (primary + sub + hybrid). Piece grouping via manuscriptId. See `docs/research/register-data-standard.md` — (2026-02-27)
- [x] External journal identity — **Resolved:** JournalRef type with freetext name (always present) + optional colophonyDomain + optional directoryIds map (keyed by platform: chillsubs, duotrope, etc.). Degrades gracefully from full federation to freetext. — (2026-02-27)
- [x] Genre model — **Resolved:** Structured enum with primary (10 values), freetext sub for subgenres, and hybrid array for cross-genre work. Lives on manuscripts (the work), not submissions (the act of sending). — (2026-02-27)
- [x] Community stats model — **Resolved:** Carried in CSR, distinguished as "community" (aggregated from tracker users, may over-report acceptances) vs. "editor_reported" (journal's own stats, authoritative). Following Chill Subs model. — (2026-02-27)

---

## Track 9 — Governance & Community Readiness (Pre-Launch)

> **Status:** Not started. Non-code deliverables required for community publisher evaluation and open-source credibility.

- [ ] [P0] AGPL license boundary documentation — clearly document what is AGPL (Zitadel), what license Colophony uses, obligations for self-hosters, and how the boundary works — (CLAUDE.md security checklist + persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P0] Choose and document Colophony's own license — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)

- [ ] [P3] Public instance identity page — human-readable page showing federation status, trust relationships, and governance commitments (the `.well-known/colophony` endpoint is machine-only) — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)

---

## Track 10 — Federation Admin UI (Pre-Launch)

> **Status:** Complete. P1 shipped (PR1: trust dashboard + overview). P2/P3 shipped (PR2: remaining 5 sub-pages).

- [x] [P1] Trust management dashboard — list trusted peers with status, capabilities, last-verified; initiate/accept/reject/revoke trust relationships; preview remote instance metadata before trusting — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)

---

## Track 11 — Chill Subs Integration (Post-Launch)

> **Status:** Conceptual. Depends on Track 8 (CSR format) and the Chill Subs relationship timeline. Sequencing: relationship → data format alignment → technical integration.

- [ ] CSR ↔ Chill Subs tracker data mapping — document field-level mapping between CSR format and Chill Subs submission tracker fields (title, journal, date sent, date responded, status, notes, submission method) — (strategy session 2026-02-27)
- [ ] Chill Subs journal directory integration — if Chill Subs exposes a journal API or data feed, use it to populate the external journal identity field in CSR records; writers who track in Chill Subs and submit via Colophony get auto-linked records — (strategy session 2026-02-27)
- [ ] Bidirectional sync protocol — define how a writer's Chill Subs tracker and Colophony submission history stay in sync; CSR as the interchange format — (strategy session 2026-02-27)
- [ ] Partnership scope definition — technical partnership vs. data integration vs. deeper structural relationship; depends on Slushpile (Chill Subs submissions manager) architecture — (strategy session 2026-02-27)

---

## Track 12 — Slate & Pipeline Polish (Post-Launch)

> **Status:** Not started. Quality-of-life improvements for the post-acceptance pipeline.

- [ ] [P2] Contract signer auto-population — populate Documenso signers from submission/author data instead of passing `signers: []` — (codebase audit 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P2] Author name in CMS publish payload — `CmsPiecePayload.author` is always `null`; fetch submitter name from user record — (codebase audit 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P2] CMS external ID tracking — store `externalId`/`externalUrl` returned from CMS publish back on the issue/items — (codebase audit 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P3] Additional CMS adapters — Substack, Contentful, or other targets based on early adopter needs — (codebase audit 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P3] In-browser copyediting or diff view between manuscript versions — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P3] READER role enforcement — define what READER can and cannot do distinct from EDITOR; currently decorative — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)
- [ ] [P3] Email invitation workflow — invite by email link/token instead of requiring pre-existing Zitadel account — (persona gap analysis 2026-02-27)

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Coolify + Hetzner managed hosting setup — (architecture doc Track 1)
- [x] Monitoring stack: Prometheus + Grafana (Sentry for errors) — done 2026-02-27 PR pending; Loki deferred to production

### Database Hardening

- [ ] Change `app_user` password from default — (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] PostgreSQL SSL/TLS (`sslmode=require`) — (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Connection pooling (PgBouncer) — (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Backups (WAL-G to S3) — (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] `pg_stat_statements` for query monitoring — (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Verify RLS in production — see `packages/db/CLAUDE.md` for verification queries — (CLAUDE.md)

### Security & Compliance

- [ ] Rotate credentials quarterly — (CLAUDE.md)

### Monitoring

- [~] GitHub GraphQL rate limit passive drain (~60 pts/hr) — diagnosed 2026-02-19, likely GitHub-internal (Dependabot, security scanning). At ~1.2% budget/hr, not actionable unless large exhaustion recurs. If so, convert skills from `gh pr list/create` (GraphQL) to `gh api` (REST) — (DEVLOG 2026-02-19)
